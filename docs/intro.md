# Intro

Welcome to the Documentation for Developers of the TeleStore online apps & games marketplace. Here, you'll find information on how to register a Developer account, properly set up and publish your Apps and Games, and utilize the TeleStore API and SDK for payment processing, user analytics, and more.

## Requirements for Applications Published on TeleStore

Your application must integrate and configure the TeleStore API or SDK for at least the following functions:
1. Tracking users who launched your application from TeleStore.
2. User registration and authentication through the TeleStore account.

   > You must also create an App URL linked to your application; otherwise, registration and authentication will not work. More details can be found in the section [Creating App URLs for Authentication through TeleStore](start/app-url).
3. Accepting and sending payments using the TeleStore payment system and the user's TeleStore account.
   > âš  Important! All payments for TeleStore users must be processed through the TeleStore payment system.
4. The application's layout must be optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
