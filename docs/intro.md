# Intro

Welcome to the documentation for the TeleStore web applications and games marketplace for developers. This section describes how to register a developer account, properly configure and publish your applications and games, and use the TeleStore API and SDK for payment processing, user analytics, and more.

## Requirements for Applications Published on TeleStore

Your application must integrate and configure the TeleStore API or SDK for at least the following functions:
1. Tracking users who launched your application from TeleStore.
2. Registering and authenticating users via TeleStore account (if your application includes login and registration).

3. Accepting and processing payments using the TeleStore payment system and the user's TeleStore account.
   <div className="important">❗️For TeleStore users, all payments must be processed through the TeleStore payment system.</div>
4. The layout of the application must be optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
5. Prohibited: [ADD / EDIT]
   - policy
   - pornography
   - racism
   - and similar content

## TeleStore and TeleStore Sandbox

The TeleStore catalog is located at https://web.tele.store. Here you will upload applications and games that are ready for publication. Each application will undergo moderation for compliance with the requirements.

We also offer the option to register in the TeleStore Sandbox at https://dev.tele.store:8081. Here you can test applications before publishing them in the production catalog, verify the correct integration of the API and SDK, test payments, and much more. All applications are published without moderation.

   <div className="important">❗️There may be glitches and bugs in the Sandbox because it is temporarily used for testing updates to the production catalog. The Sandbox will soon be migrated to a separate stable version, updated to the production version of the catalog.</div>
