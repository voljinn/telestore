# üõ†Ô∏è Working with SDK

## Intro

Currently, there is only a server-side SDK for Node.js, but you can use the examples from the [Test Application](testapp.md) to implement integration in JavaScript/TypeScript on the client side. The release of the SDK for Unity is scheduled for May 2025.

API References for [TeleStore](../api-telestore) and [TrexWallet](../api-trexwallet), the TeleStore payment system (for advanced wallet functionalities), are also available.
