# üéÆ TeleStore Test App

## Intro

This application is made for easier integration of TeleStore SDK with examples, including using the SDK for applications without server side.

The application consists of two parts: client-side and server-side. Your application may not have a server side, and some processes may differ depending on your implementation.

This documentation is also available at [GitHub](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app).

## Installation

### Application
You can view it at this link: https://test.tele.store

### Source Code of the Application
Available on GitHub at this link: https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app.

### Download
```
sudo git clone https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app telestore_test_app
```

For launching the application, use [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

## Client side, option 1: without app authorisation.

### Obtaining User Information

To retrieve user information, redirect the user to the following TeleStore URL:
```
https://web.tele.store/redirect_ext_auth.html?get_user_info=${APP_URL_ID}
```

Where `APP_URL_ID`  is the URL identifier of your application registered in TeleStore (Profile ‚û° Security ‚û° App URLs).

[User Redirection Example](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/client/page.tsx#L152)

After retrieving the data, TeleStore redirects the user back to your application at the following URL:
```
{YOUR_APP_URL}/?usr={USER_INFO}&check={CHECK_HASH}
```
Where:
- `YOUR_APP_URL` is the URL of your application.
- `USER_INFO` is a base64-encoded string containing an object with user data.
- `CHECK_HASH` is a hash used for data validation.

The param `usr` contains a Base64 encoded string with a serialized JSON object:
```
usr=eyJpZCI6MTczMDIzMDQwMTgwOTIyOSwiZmlyc3RfbiI6IkZpcnN0bmFtZSIsInNlY29uZF9uIjoiTGFzdG5hbWUiLCJ1dGMiOiIyMDI1LTAyLTA0VDEzOjUyOjQ1LjYzNDk3WiJ9
```

```javascript
{
    "id": 1730230401809229, // TeleStore ID of the client
    "first_n": "First Name", // first Name
    "second_n": "Last Name", // last Name
    "utc": "2025-02-04T13:52:45.63497Z" // timestamp
}
```

The param `check` contains the hashed HMACSHA256 with a developer's public key and user data in the form of a JSON string (UTF-8 encoded):
```javascript
check=ehcX3ApkjpyV42SaeFRALNQ17S7Q0ksitgcXSWRTd3A
```

### Data Validation

It is recommended to check the signature to ensure undisturbed communication. Validation can be performed either on the server side or on the client side (not recommended, because you need to store the public key on the client side).

For reference, here is the code snippet from the JavaScript implementation of a process on TeleStore's side:
```javascript
/** Get user info */
let userData = JSON.parse(atob(userEncoded));

/** Validate user info on server side */
const publicKeyBytes = Buffer.from(PUBLIC_USER_KEY, "hex");
const userDataUtf8Bytes = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(userData), "utf-8");
const sha256Hash = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(publicKeyBytes).digest();
const hmacHash = crypto.createHmac("sha256", sha256Hash).update(userDataUtf8Bytes).digest();
const checkStrBase64 = toBase64Url(hmacHash);
```

Where `PUBLIC_USER_KEY` is public key of your developer account.

If the signature is correct and the timestamp is not too old, then the developer has obtained valid TeleStore user data.

#### Server-Side Validation

You can validate the received data on your server by sending it from your client application and then performing the necessary validation steps.

[Server-Side Validation Example](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/api/validate_usr_info/route.ts#L21)

#### Client-Side Validation

We do not recommend this validation method, as it requires storing your application's public key on the client side, which may reduce the security of your application.

[Client-Side Validation Example](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/client/page.tsx#L159)

## Client side, option 2: user authorisation through TeleStore (client session)

If your application does not have a server-side, you can authorise your user via TeleStore. This will allow you to perform several authorised actions, such as retrieving user information, checking their balance, making a transfer to your application account, saving, or loading application data.

### Authorisation via Redirect

You can authorise the user by redirecting to the following URL:
```
https://web.tele.store/redirect_ext_auth.html?auth_app=${APP_URL_ID}
```

Where `APP_URL_ID` is the URL identifier of your application registered in TeleStore (Profile ‚û° Security ‚û° App URLs).

After successful authorisation, the user is redirected to the following URL:
```
{YOUR_APP_URL}/?auth_code={AUTH_CODE}
```

Subsequently, the `auth_code` can be used to create a new session.

[Redirect Authentication Example](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/client/page.tsx#L200)

### Authorisation via Popup

You can authorise the user by opening a URL inside a Popup window:
```
https://web.tele.store/redirect_ext_auth.html?auth_app=${APP_URL_ID}&popup=true
```

Where:
- `APP_URL_ID` is the URL identifier of your application registered in TeleStore (Profile ‚û° Security ‚û° App URLs).
- `popup=true` is a required parameter for successful authentication.

[Popup Authentication Example](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/client/page.tsx#L207)

## Server Side

### TeleStore SDK

For easier development, we recommend using the [official TeleStore SDK](https://github.com/telestore-rep/SDK). It allows you to obtain new sessions, create invoices, retrieve transaction history and SSE updates, etc.

### Creating a New Session

[//]: # (To create a new session, you need to generate a new User Key in your TeleStore developer account &#40;Profile ‚û° Security ‚û° User keys&#41;.)

[Example of session creation via SDK](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/api/sdk_connect/route.ts#L7)

### Retrieving Account Information

To retrieve developer account information, send an authorised request to:
```
GET https://web.tele.store/api/v1/teleuser_details
```

[Example of retrieving account information](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/api/teleuser_detailts/route.ts#L8)

### Subscribing to SSE

To subscribe to SSE events, create an object of the `EventSource` class ([recommended library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eventsource)):

```javascript
let esLink = new EventSource("https://web.tele.store/auth/v1/subscribe", {
  fetch: (input, init) =>
    fetch(input, {
      ...init,
      headers: {
        ...init?.headers,
        Cookie: `sid=${sid}`
      }
    })
});

esLink.onmessage = async (event) => {
  console.log(event.data);
}

esLink.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error("EventSource error:", error);
}
```

[Example of SSE connection](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/api/connect_sse/route.ts#L17)

### Receiving Webhooks

To receive webhooks, add a new App URL (Profile ‚û° Security ‚û° Apps URLs), specifying the <span className="checkbox">‚úÖ Use for Webhooks</span> flag and the API method URL that will serve as a webhook. Example webhook URL:
```
POST https://test.tele.store/webhook
```

[Webhook example](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/webhook/route.ts#L10)

### Retrieving Developer App List

To retrieve the developer's app list, send an authorised request to:
```
GET https://web.tele.store/api/v1/dev_list_my_apps
```

[Example of retrieving developer app list](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/api/dev_list_apps/route.ts#L8)

### Retrieving Developer Balance Information

To retrieve developer balance information, send an authorised request to:
```
GET https://web.tele.store/trex/v1/wallet/get_balance
PARAMS {
    currency: TeleUSD
}
```

[Example of retrieving developer balance information](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/api/balance_info/route.ts#L8)

### Creating a Transfer to a TeleStore User

To create a transfer to a TeleStore user, send an authorised request to:
```
POST https://web.tele.store/trex/v1/wallet/internal_transfer
BODY {
    "recipient": 123, // recipient ID
    "currency": "TeleUSD",
    "amount": 10, // transaction amount
    "tag": "" // transaction description
}
```

You will receive a server response:
```
BODY {
    "txId": 123, // transaction ID
    "confirmCode": 123 // transaction confirmation code
}
```

The second request confirms the transaction:
```
POST https://web.tele.store/trex/v1/wallet/internal_transfer
PARAMS {
    "confirmationTimetick": 123, // transaction ID
    "confirmationCode": 123 // transaction confirmation code
}
BODY {
    "recipient": 123, // recipient ID
    "currency": "TeleUSD",
    "amount": 10, // transaction amount
    "tag": "" // transaction description
}
```

[Example of creating a transfer to a TeleStore user](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/server/page.tsx#L204)

### Retrieving TeleStore Transaction History

To retrieve transaction history, send an authorised request to:
```
GET https://web.tele.store/trex/v1/wallet/get_history_transactions
PARAMS {
    currencies=[TeleUSD],
    start="2022-05-10" // Start date (without time) UTC, defaults to 90 days before end if not set
    end="2022-05-10" // End date (without time) UTC, defaults to current date if not set
    next_key=123 // Last identifier for lazy loading
    tx_types=[] // Operation type filter
    limit=10 // Number of transactions in the sample, min - 10, max - 100
}
```

[Example of retrieving transaction history](https://github.com/telestore-rep/test-app/blob/ff743c7db872b19f9ac69f32fabdf2c59dd6f737/src/app/api/get_transactions/route.ts#L9)
