# Creating a Developer Account

To get started, let's register an account. You can do this on the TeleStore website or through the Telegram bot. We recommend registering via the Telegram bot for easier data verification.

## Registration Through the Telegram Bot

1. Open the bot [@TeleStoreChatBot](https://t.me/TeleStoreChatBot) in Telegram and press the Start button.
2. The bot will prompt you to share your Contact to verify your phone number. In the bottom menu, click on 📞 Link my phone to share your contact with the bot. Phone verification is necessary to accept payments and withdraw funds.
3. You will also need to verify your email. Click on the 📧 Link my email button in the bottom menu and send the bot your existing email address.
4. A code, such as `ecode-...` will be sent to your email. Copy the entire code (including `ecode-`) and send it to the bot.

## Registration Through the Website
